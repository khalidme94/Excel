#Weekend Project

###You are the founder of XYZ company. You are getting ready for a fundraising round, and you need to have your financial models all put together. Create a spreadsheet model that incorporated your assumptions, a cash flow statement, and an income statement.

###Provide your potential investor with many visualizations that help drive the strong points of your business. Perform sensitivity analysis on some of your assumptions and see how flexible they are to your goals.
